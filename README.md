# full-stack-project-four
In this project, I created a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard or pressing keys on a keyboard.

Using a template provided I added all of the JavaScript necessary to run the program and added the following styles to the stylesheet.

1. changed the background color of the page.
2. added a lightslategrey border to the letters and keys.
3. changed the background color of the keys and letters.
4. added a white border to keys that have been attempted.
5. added a white border to letters that have been revealed.
